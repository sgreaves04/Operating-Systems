In iOS 14, Apple adds a Security Recommendations feature. It will alert you when your password has appeared in a known data leak/breach. It also suggests you change passwords that are used by other people, which makes them easy to guess. Navigate to Settings > Passwords > Security Recommendations to activate it.
Android 10 adds more granular control over how an app can use location information. Prior to Android 10, once you gave an app access to your location, it was always on and (potentially) always tracking. With Android 10, you have the option of letting an app access your location information only while you're actively using the app. Not only is this an important privacy matter, but also it's sure to help save on battery life.
