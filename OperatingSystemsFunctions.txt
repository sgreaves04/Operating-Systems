In iOS 14, Apple adds a Security Recommendations feature. It will alert you when your password has appeared in a known data leak/breach. It also suggests you change passwords that are used by other people, which makes them easy to guess. Navigate to Settings > Passwords > Security Recommendations to activate it.
Android 10 adds more granular control over how an app can use location information. Prior to Android 10, once you gave an app access to your location, it was always on and (potentially) always tracking. With Android 10, you have the option of letting an app access your location information only while you're actively using the app. Not only is this an important privacy matter, but also it's sure to help save on battery life.
 But the Snip & Sketch utility takes screen capture to a whole new level. You don’t have to enable anything, so long as you’ve updated your Windows 10 install with the latest updates. Press Shift–Windows Key–S to start your screen capture. What makes Snip & Sketch special from the traditional Print Screen is that you can capture non-standard areas if you like (choose the freehand tool first), and after taking the screen capture, you can edit it and mark it up with your own sketches or notes.
